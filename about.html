            <h1><strong>My name is...</strong></h1>
            <p>Ayomide Oluwafunmilade Akinleye, my nickname is Diamond but I sometimes go by Joy. I am a Yoruba girl
                from
                Ogun State, Nigeria. I’m an introvert but would be outside if something fun and worth my interest is
                happening. I’m not sure I know the values that describe me but I’m just a girl who wants to develop
                herself
                and be a better person every day. </p>

            <p>I aspire to be a FullStack website developer, though my learning process is pretty slow and I sometimes
                wonder if I’m cut out for programming (JavaScript can make one wonder). Can’t say I’ve fully mastered
                HTML
                and CSS too but I’m going to achieve my goals very soon.</p>

                <p> I enjoy watching animes, I enjoy playing Long Tennis (haven’t played in a long time though), I enjoy
                    reading
                    books(novels) too. I have interest in Photography, Web3 and crypto. “Tech” excites me a lot, be it
                    software
                    engineering, cyber-security, website development, robotics, artificial intelligence, the world is
                    just a
                    better place with technology. I do not have a favourite food but I do enjoy delectable meals.If you
                    enjoyed this brief gist about myself, how about you check this lovely <a
